# Species Richness Calculations

In this script, we will calculate:

a) Site-wise species richness to understand if species composition across treatment types are distinctly different. 
b) Repeat the above three calculations, but using species traits - If a species is a rainforest specialist or an open-country generalist.

Install required libraries
```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(dplyr)
library(stringr)
library(vegan)
library(ggplot2)
library(scico)
library(data.table)

# Source any custom/other internal functions necessary for analysis
source("code/01_internal-functions.R")
```

To start with, we will compute species richness from 5 non-consecutive days for each site for each season (following Campos-Cerqueira et al., 2019)

At the moment, data exists to calculate species richness for one season only (data collected between March 2020 - May 2020) and 3 visits to a site have been completed.

We will use a excel sheet of annotations, which contains 10s-clips from each site (A random 16-min was chosen between 6am and 10am and divided into 10s chunks for the ease of annotations)
```{r}
# Attach the 2020_summer_annotation data 
data <- read.csv("data/2020-summer-annotation-working-document.csv")

# Site-wise sorting of the 16-min of data
# Split the file names into 4 columns : Site, Date, Time and Splits   
data <- separate(data, col = Filename, into = c("Site", "Date", "Time", "Splits"), sep = "_")
data

# Load the species-trait-data
trait_dat <- read.csv("data/species-trait-dat.csv")
```

How many visits (counted as number of unique days) to a site has been annotated? Please note that some sites have more than 3 visits to a site, and hence we ensure that we choose only three non-consecutive visits to a given site
```{r}
# At the moment 1-3 days at each site has been annotated
# Some sites have only 1 visit. See SEL sites (Selaliparai)
# Some sites even have 4 visits, but we will choose 3 random visits only

# Number of visits to a particular site
nSites_Days <- data %>%
  dplyr::select(Site, Date)%>%
  distinct() %>% arrange(Site) %>% count(Site)

# Unique date site combination to give you a sense of sampling
uniqueSiteDate <- data %>%
  group_by(Site) %>%
  distinct(Date)

# Convert date column to YMD format using lubridate::ymd()
uniqueSiteDate$Date <- lubridate::ymd(uniqueSiteDate$Date)

# The below lines of code were written following a query on stackOverflow to select three non-consecutive visits to any site
# Link: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/67212152/select-non-consecutive-dates-for-every-grouped-element-in-r

nonConVisits <- uniqueSiteDate%>% 
  ungroup() %>% 
  group_split(Site) %>% 
  map_df(., ~ .x %>% ungroup() %>%
           arrange(Date) %>%
           mutate(n = 1) %>%
           complete(Date = seq.Date(first(Date), last(Date), by = 'days')) %>%
           group_by(n = cumsum(is.na(n))) %>%
           filter(!is.na(Site)) %>%
           filter(row_number() %% 2 == 1) %>%
           ungroup() %>%
           sample_n(min(n(), 3))
         ) %>%
  select(-n)

# Change the structure of the date column back to character for using one of the join functions
nonConVisits$Date <- str_remove_all(as.character(nonConVisits$Date),"-")

# Left-join with the original dataframe to subset the data for analysis
datSubset <- left_join(nonConVisits,data)

# Save this data as a .csv for future analysis (later scripts)
write.csv(datSubset,"data/datSubset.csv", row.names = F)
```

Now group the data by site and restoration type and sum the number of detections across sites. At the moment, we will calculate the overall number of detections for each 10s clip, which will be used to estimate species richness. 
```{r}
# Calculate the overall number of detections for each site across 1-3 days of data (translates to 16min to 48min of data per site)
# We would like to obtain a max of 3 visits to a site only (some sites have 4 visits)

nDetections_Site <- data %>%
  group_by(Site, Restoration.Type) %>%
  summarise_at(.vars = vars(c("IP":"CR")),.funs = sum) %>% 
  transform() %>% replace(is.na(.), 0)
```

Convert the detections to 1, since we are interested in calculating richness per site by converting values >1 to 1 for multiple visits to a site. In other words, we want to establish overall species richness for a 16-min to 48-min window.
```{r}
richness <- nDetections_Site  %>% 
  mutate_at(vars(c("IP":"CR")),~ replace(., . > 0, 1)) %>%
  rowwise() %>% 
  mutate(richness = sum(c_across(IP:CR))) %>%
  dplyr::select(Site, Restoration.Type, richness)

# Test if there are significant differences in richness across treatment types
model <- lm(richness~Restoration.Type, data = richness)
anova <-  aov(model)
 
# Tukey test to study each pair of treatment - reveals no signficant difference across treatment types
tukey <- TukeyHSD(x=anova, 'Restoration.Type', conf.level=0.95)

# Create a boxplot of species richness by group (Here: group refers to Restoration Type)
# Temporary plots based on uneven visits to a site. Note it ranges from 1 to 3 visits.

fig_richness <- ggplot(richness, aes(x=Restoration.Type, y=richness, fill=Restoration.Type)) +  geom_boxplot(alpha=0.7) + 
    scale_fill_scico_d(palette = "roma") +
    theme_bw() +
    labs(x="Restoration Type", 
       y="Species Richness") +
    theme(axis.title = element_text(size = 16, face = "bold"), 
        axis.ticks.length.x = unit(.5, "cm"),
        axis.text = element_text(size = 14),
        legend.title = element_blank(),
        legend.key.size = unit(1,"cm"),
        legend.text = element_text(size = 12))

ggsave(fig_richness, filename = "figs/fig_richness.png", width=12, height=7,
       device = png(), units="in", dpi = 300);dev.off()

knitr::include_graphics("figs/fig_richness.png")

# We observe that the overall species richness is relatively higher in passively restored forest patches, followed by benchmark (protected area) forest patches and actively restored forest patches
```

Using species trait data to check if species richness varies by treatment type as a function of whether a species is a rainforest specialist vs. open-country specialist.
To do so: Add an additional column of species-trait data and group data based on the same.
```{r}

# First, we pivot the species-codes and then match the codes with trait_data and reformat the data to keep all detections>0 as 1 else they are 0

richness_trait <- nDetections_Site %>%
  pivot_longer(cols=IP:CR, names_to="Species_Code", values_to="count") %>%
  left_join(.,trait_dat, by=c("Species_Code"="species_annotation_codes")) %>%
  dplyr::select(-c(scientific_name)) %>%
  mutate(forRichness = case_when(count>0 ~ 1,
                                 count==0 ~ 0))

# Calculate overall richness for each site as a function of rainforest species and open-country species

richness_trait <-  richness_trait %>%
  dplyr::select(Site, Restoration.Type, Species_Code, Habitat, forRichness) %>%
  group_by(Site, Restoration.Type, Habitat) %>%
  summarise(richness = sum(forRichness))

# Plot the above result
fig_richness_trait <- ggplot(richness_trait, aes(x=Restoration.Type, y=Richness, fill=Habitat)) +
    geom_boxplot(alpha=0.7) + 
    scale_fill_scico_d(palette = "roma") +
    theme_bw() +
    labs(x="Restoration Type", 
       y="Species Richness") +
    theme(axis.title = element_text(size = 16, face = "bold"), 
        axis.ticks.length.x = unit(.5, "cm"),
        axis.text = element_text(size = 14),
        legend.title = element_blank(),
        legend.key.size = unit(1,"cm"),
        legend.text = element_text(size = 12))

ggsave(fig_richness_trait, filename = "figs/fig_richness_trait.png", width=12, height=7,
       device = png(), units="in", dpi = 300); dev.off()

knitr::include_graphics("figs/fig_richness_trait.png")
```
